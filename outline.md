# Outline File

This is used to outline plans for the guide.

Each page of the guide is a separate file marked in the outline with a number.

If two pages are very similar they can share a number (1a, 1b). For example, some pages from the CSS guide and JS Guide will be similar to each other with slight differences.

Numbers under 10 are high priority.

Items marked with a start * require further discussion.
