# Sharing your Mods

Author(s): code3z (code3)

The [modding forum](https://forum.vivaldi.net/category/52/modifications) will be
extremely helpful for learning how to mod and getting mods from others. You will
need a [Vivaldi account](https://login.vivaldi.net) to post there. You might
also want a GitHub and/or GitLab account as another way to share your mods.

---

Once you‚Äôve created a mod that you‚Äôre proud of, the next step is to share it.
Sharing will be a big help to other people. You can also get feedback and help
from the community. But it will also mean you have to respond to bugs in your
code and help other people use your code.

## Managing and Sharing Mods using Git

You can use Git repository hosting services such as GitHub and GitLab to upload,
manage, share, and collaborate on mods. See the Managing Mods guide for more
information on Git.

## Code Headers

Putting a comment at the top of your code helps people understand it, use it,
and remember where it came from. Consider using a header like this:

```css
/**
 * <title>
 * https://forum.vivaldi.net/topic/<topic>
 * Description: <description>
 *              <if your description is long, continue it here>
 * Filename:    <filename>
 * Platform:    <All/Linux/Mac/Windows>
 * Version:     Vivaldi version <version>
 * Author(s):   <forum/GitHub/GitLab username, contributors>
**/
```

### Versioning Your Mods

Instead of versioning your mods separately, it‚Äôs easier and sometimes more
helpful to include the latest version of Vivaldi that it was tested in. Along
with the last update time and version history (shown by Git or the forum), this
will let you and others know how up-to-date the mod is.

If you do want to version your mods, please include the Vivaldi version as well.

## Posting Mods to the Forum

### Tagging Forum Posts

Tagging your mods helps others find them. Use the forum tagging feature to
insert the following tags, in addition to any others that make sense:

 1. [Modding]
 2. [CSS] and/or [JavaScript]
 3. [Area]‚Äîwhat area of the UI does it affect?

If the tag doesn‚Äôt exist, the forum software will create it‚Äîbut please **don‚Äôt
make new tags** on your own! Only use tags that are suggested from the
drop-down.

## Describing Your Mods

Now that you‚Äôve added your code, titled your post, and tagged it, you need to
write content! What you write is really up to you, but be sure to include what
the mod does, how it will help people, and if it has any shortcomings or bugs
or if it does not work with certain settings.

You should also **include a screenshot**. If the mod does something that can
only be shown through a screen recording, take a screen recording and upload
it as a GIF. You can find some screen recording tools in the resources section
of this guide.

Good job, I hope to see your mods soon! üëç
