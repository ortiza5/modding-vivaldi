# Welcome to modding!

Modding Vivaldi will allow you to achieve new functionality and looks for your browser. <TODO> you can see some examples below.


*CSS mods* allow you to change the style of the browser. *JS mods* allow you to add functionality to the browser. Before you make any mods, you need to know how to [install mods](<TODO>: add link).

Then, you can start learning how to create mods by learning how to use the [developer tools](<TODO>: Add link). Have fun!
