# Modding Vivaldi ![Modding Vivaldi logo](assets/logo/favicon/favicon-32x32.png)

This repository will eventually contain some guides to help you with modding the
Vivaldi browser.

**Please note that modifications are not officially supported by Vivaldi. There
is no guarantee that they will work, they may even break Vivaldi. Vivaldi have
no obligation to support modifications or keep the browser backwards-compatible
for them.**

**When a modification stops working, do not blame Vivaldi and instead ask the
author of the modification politely if they can fix it. When reporting bugs to
Vivaldi, make sure that you have all modifications disabled.**
